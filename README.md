Gameplay - Python

How to Play:

1. Run __init__.py
2. Control Both Players
  - You control both the blue and orange players.
  - The active player (the one you're currently controlling) is marked by a white square at its head.
  - The bot-controlled player has a solid-colored head.
3. Move & Strategize
  - Use the arrow keys to navigate.
  - Reach your goal: If you're the blue player and the target is blue, race to the bottom as fast as possible!
  - If you're the orange player and the target is blue, your job is to:
    - 1. Intercept the blue player before they reach their goal.
    - 2. Boost health by collecting gray squares.
    - 3. Flip the board to swap movement directions.
    - 4. Swap player control by stepping into the gridded zone and pressing SPACE BAR.
4. Win the Game!
  - Score the most points or be the last player standing with health left to claim victory.
